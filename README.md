The application assists users in monitoring their daily dietary habits and offers guidance for making healthier lifestyle choices. We adopted the Code First approach and implemented the N-tier Design pattern within the .NET Ecosystem for its development. The application comprises two distinct roles: User and Admin. Administrators have the authority to add food items and meals, as well as to search for users and access their data. Users can select foods that have been previously added to their daily dietary plan and monitor their dietary intake accordingly.
